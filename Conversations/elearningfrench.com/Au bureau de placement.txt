A woman goes to the employment agency to find a maid. She is received by the manager.
Iâ€™d like a maid who likes to take care of children.
Is it for Paris or for the suburbs?
Neuilly exactly.
I think I have someone who will be suitable for you.
What's her name?
Her name is Marie Ledoux. If you want to wait a minute, I'll send for her.
(The maid comes in)
I have three children, two of whom go to school. But for the heavy work, I already have someone. Where have you worked until now?
I've worked for Colonel Lavigne for two years. Unfortunately, he's going abroad with his family.
How much do you earn?
Three hundred francs a month and the Lavignes pay all the Social Security. To get more information you can phone them.
What were you doing before that?
I was in the home of a Brazilian diplomat who had four children.
Is he still in Paris?
No, he was assigned to London a little more than two years ago.
Will you sometimes be able to take care of the children in the evening?
Certainly, I almost never go out.
You will have one day off a week. Could you begin tomorrow?
No, I'd prefer to start Monday. I'm going to spend a few days at my mother's and will be back Sunday.
Then I'll have your room made ready for that day.
