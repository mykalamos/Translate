Paul et Jean are on their way to Belgium in Jean's car. They are already near the border.
It's hardly two hours since we’ve been on the way.
And we're getting near Belgium.
We really haven't been very long.
Yes, everything has gone well. Do you already know this country?
Yes, I had the chance to make a trip there when I was a student. And you?
I lived there three years. And now I go there occasionally on business.
It's very fast by car, isn't it?
Yes, you have to figure about four hours from Paris to Brussels. Well, here we are already at the border. I recognize the countryside.
I hope the formalities won’t hold us up too long.
Here's my passport. Do you have yours?
(The customs official arrives)
Do you have anything to declare? Jewels? Securities?
No, nothing. We’re only making a short sightseeing trip.
Would you indicate the amount of money that you are carrying? That's fine. No alcohol, cigarettes, perfume?
No, absolutely nothing but personal effects.
Would you open this suitcase, please?
Should I open mine too?
That’s enough. Everything is in order.
There’s a customs that’s easy to go through.
After all, we had a clear conscience. What's more, they are less strict than they used to be.
