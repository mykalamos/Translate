Mrs. Dupuis and Mr. Martin are talking about their children. Mr. Martin is an American. He is not up to date on questions of schooling in France.
Where will you be sending your children?
We might enroll them in the lycée.
Why don’t you send them to the American school?
Because we prefer that they learn French well. And yours?
This year they are all going to school.
Even Françoise?
Yes, she is entering kindergarten.
Already? How old is she then?
She'll be five in January.
Will she stay there all day?
No, I'll take her in the morning and Jacqueline will bring her back at noon.
What a job you'll have to get the children ready on time.
Not that much. This year Michel and Jean will be boarding.
That seems fine to me. What grade are they going into?
Michel in fourth and Jean in sixth.
Isn't Michel the older?
Yes, you forget that in France they start with the eleventh. Have your children already taken French lessons?
Not yet. Would you know somebody who could give them a few lessons?
No, but at the Embassy they could suggest a teacher.
That's a good idea. Thank you very much.
You can find out by phone.
Oh! It's not far. I’m going to take advantage of it and go there now.
